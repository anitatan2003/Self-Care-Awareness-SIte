      <h1> About us </h2>
      <p class="bio"> Hi! This was a project for the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. Our goal for this website was to spread awareness of the importance of self care. 
      
    
      <!-- About Anita -->
      <h3>Anita Tan</h3>
      <p class="bio">My name is Anita Tan! I am a high school senior from Seattle, Washington. During covid, I felt that my mind was constatly stressed from the events happening in the world and schoolwork. This took a toll on my health. I had trouble sleeping and I became stressed at the point where I couldn't destress when I learned about mental health. Like me, many people don't take this topic seriously until they are affected. This site is developed to inform more people about the importance of caring for their mental health!</p>

      <!-- About Nenya -->
      <h3> Nenya Greenlee </h3>
      <p class="bio"> My name is Nenya Greenlee. I am a high school sophmore in Rock Hill, South Carolina. Over this past year I have found that school has been more stressful, I thought that this might have just been because it was my first year in high school, and it was half in person and half virtual. But if I have learned anything from these past two years is how important mental health is, and how little it is acknowleged until it effects someone personaly. </p>
