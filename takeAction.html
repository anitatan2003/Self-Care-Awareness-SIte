      <h2> What is self-care and why does it matter?</h2>
      <p class="text">Self-care is defined as the practice of taking action to maintain or improve oneâ€™s health, either mentally or physically. You have probably been told that eating healthy, regular exercising, and getting good sleep is important for your physical health. Mental health has an impact on physical health as well. It is important to develop good habits (just like you would to get physically healthy) to get mentally strong & healthy! Take a look at the Ted Talk below explaining the significance of incoporating self-care practices in your life.</p>

        <strong>Many overlook that performing a simple, yet enjoyable task can actually affect your life. It's unnoticeble short-term, but long-term, it affects your mood, mindset and potentially the way you make decisions. It could be anything, and doing that one activity you enjoy will allow you to look foward to everyday. This activity could be journaling, sleeping early, or waking up early to have quiet time to yourself.

        <strong>To some it may seem like a silly thing, since talking to people is such a normal thing. Some people do not, or cannot make the effort to talk to people they are comfortable with. Maintaining and initiating new friendships are such an important aspect of life. Friendships allow a sense of community and allow the brain to grow with other people's perspectives on life. Research shows that connecting with people increases happiness, longevity, and health. Talking to others are also important, because it helps the people that have any conditions making them unable to initiate conversations to form friendships. In some instances, you are improving yourself while helping others.

        <strong>Working hard is a great thing but overworking is not. Make sure to take breaks often if you know that you need to get a lot of work done. Learn to notice signs of overworking by your fatigue levels, sore body, or if you are starting to have trouble focusing. Balance life with work by doing things that you enjoy outside of work. It could be going out with friends or going out for a walk. This will ensure that you won't feel like work is taking over your life.
